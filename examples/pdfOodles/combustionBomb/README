A closed volume combustion bomb, the setup is taken from Nwagwe et al., MEASUREMENTS AND LARGE EDDY SIMULATIONS OF TURBULENT PREMIXED FLAME KERNEL GROWTH, Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, Volume 28, 2000/pp. 59â€“65.
This features of this testcase are a constant mixture fraction and a constant enthalpy. The grid resolution is rather coarse. The initial velocity field is generated by Kornevs method of turbulent spots.
